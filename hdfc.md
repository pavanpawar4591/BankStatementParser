# Deployment Documentation for Bank Statement Parsing Script

## Introduction

This document provides instructions on deploying and running the Python script for parsing bank statements and generating insights on spending. The script processes a CSV file containing bank statement data with columns: "Txn Date", "Value Date", "Description", "Ref No./Cheque No.", "Debit", "Credit", and "Balance". It calculates spending by category and provides total spending.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the script, ensure the following are installed:

1. Python 3: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Required Libraries: The script uses the `pandas` library. Install it using the following command:


## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the bank statement parsing script:

1. **Download the Script:**

Download the Python script to your desired deployment location. Ensure that the CSV bank statement file is also available in the same directory or provide the full file path in the script.

2. **CSV File Format:**

Ensure that the CSV bank statement file follows the format with the columns as mentioned in the introduction. If the file has a custom delimiter, update the script to use the correct delimiter in the `pd.read_csv()` function.

3. **Customizing Category Extraction:**

If you need to customize the rules for extracting categories from the "Description" column, modify the `extract_category()` function in the script. Add more rules as per your requirements.

4. **Run the Script:**

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run the script using the following command:



Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the Python script file.

5. **Results:**

The script will process the CSV bank statement and generate insights on spending by category. The results will be saved in a file named "spending_insights.txt" in the same directory as the script.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors during deployment or execution of the script, check the following:
- Ensure that Python 3 and the required libraries are properly installed.
- Verify the CSV file format and column names.
- Check for any specific error messages in the terminal.

## Conclusion

This deployment documentation should guide you through the process of setting up and running the bank statement parsing script. If you face any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to the development team for assistance.

Please note that this is a basic template, and you may need to customize it based on your specific deployment environment and requirements. Add more details if necessary, such as how the script will be scheduled to run, any security considerations, or other dependencies specific to your deployment setup.
